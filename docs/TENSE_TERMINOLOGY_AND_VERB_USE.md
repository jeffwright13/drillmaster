## Notes on Usage

- In everyday Mexican Spanish, the **“Going-to” Future (voy a + infinitive)** is used far more often than the Simple Future (correré), except for promises or predictions.  
- The **Preterite** is the dominant past tense for completed actions and storytelling.  
- **Present Perfect** is less common in Mexico than in Spain; it is used mainly for lifetime experiences or very recent events.  
- Spanish gerunds are used only for ongoing actions, not habitual ones.
