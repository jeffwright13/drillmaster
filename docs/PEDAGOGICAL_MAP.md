# Spanish Verb & Tense Pedagogical Map

This document outlines a practical, efficiency-focused path for introducing Spanish verbs and verb tenses. It is designed for adult learners preparing for real-world communication in Mexico (so no "vos" or "vosotros").

## Core Principle

Introduce new tenses **gradually**, and apply each new tense first to the **earliest tiers of verbs**, not to all verbs at once. This prevents overload and maximizes communicative payoff.

---

## Tense Introduction Order

1. Present  
2. Gerund / Present Progressive (estoy comiendo)  
3. “Going to” Future (voy a comer)  
4. Preterite (comí, fui, hice…)  
5. Present Perfect (he comido)  
6. Simple Future (comeré) — optional and introduced last

---

## Verb Tiers

### Tier 1: Foundations  
hablar, comer, vivir, ser, estar, tener, hacer, ir, poder, querer, necesitar, llevar, irse, llamarse

### Tier 2: Daily Routines / Reflexives  
levantarse, sentarse, acostarse, despertarse, ducharse, lavarse, lavar, ponerse, vestirse, quedarse

### Tier 3: Irregular Essentials  
venir, poner, salir, dar, ver, decir, saber, oír, traer, creer

### Tier 4: Emotional / Cognitive (Stem-changers and reflexives)  
pensar, entender, sentir, sentirse, conocer, encontrar, encontrarse, preocuparse, divertirse

### Tier 5: Gustar-Type Verbs (Special Grammar Structure)  
gustar, encantar, molestar, importar, faltar, doler, parecer

# How to Introduce Tenses by Tier

## Tier 1 Verbs  
Tense order:  
**Present → Gerund → Going-to Future → Preterite → Present Perfect → Simple Future**

Reason: These verbs are the most frequent and easiest to apply new tenses to.

---

## Tier 2 Verbs  
Tense order:  
**Present → Gerund → Going-to Future → Preterite**

Notes:  
- Tier 2 introduces reflexives heavily.  
- Avoid Present Perfect and Simple Future here until later.

---

## Tier 3 Verbs  
Tense order:  
**Present → Gerund → Going-to Future → Preterite → Present Perfect**

Notes:  
- These verbs contain irregularities that are useful to master early.  
- Simple future is optional.

---

## Tier 4 Verbs  
Tense order:  
**Present → Gerund → Going-to Future → Present Perfect**  

Notes:  
- These verbs involve stem-changing patterns and emotional concepts.  
- Avoid Perfect and Simple Future until much later.

---

## Tier 5 Verbs  
Tense order:  
**Present → Going-to Future → Preterite**

Notes:  
- These follow special “gustar-type” grammar (me gusta, me duele).  
- Save Perfect, Imperfect, and Simple Future for advanced study.
